## Running the Project

### Backend
```bash
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
```

The API will be available at `http://localhost:8000`

**API Documentation:**
- Swagger UI: http://localhost:8000/docs
- ReDoc: http://localhost:8000/redoc

### Frontend
```bash
cd my-app
npm install
npm run dev
```

The frontend will be available at `http://localhost:3000`

## Next Steps

To complete the full Notion-like experience, the following frontend work is recommended:

1. **Block Renderer Component** - Render all 9 block types
2. **Rich Text Editor** - Formatting menu on text selection
3. **Slash Command Menu** - Quick block insertion
4. **Sidebar Navigation** - Hierarchical page tree
5. **Search UI** - Quick find interface
6. **Comments UI** - Comment threads and discussions
7. **Activity Feed UI** - Notification center
8. **Drag & Drop** - Visual block reordering

## Testing

Test the API using the interactive Swagger UI at `http://localhost:8000/docs` or use tools like:
- Postman
- cURL
- HTTPie
- Insomnia

Example:
```bash
# Create a text block
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/blocks \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "id": "block-1",
    "type": "text",
    "textType": "h1",
    "value": "Hello World"
  }'

# Create a page
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/pages \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "id": "page-1",
    "title": "My First Page",
    "blockIds": ["block-1"]
  }'
```

## Conclusion

This project provides a solid foundation for a Notion-like application with:
- âœ… 28 API endpoints
- âœ… 9 block types
- âœ… Complete page hierarchy system
- âœ… Full collaboration features
- âœ… Search functionality
